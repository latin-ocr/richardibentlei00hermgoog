cis Burmann, Perizonius, Dorville, and many other ³
distinguished literary characters, with whom Bentley
4⁰4 was in the habits of intimate correspondence at diffe- κ
'rent periods of his life. These original documents,
’ which wera supposed to have beenlost, were duco- ,
yered in the Lodge of Trinity Collega, upon the death χ
of the late Master. of this whole collection not more l
Ι than three or four haro ever been before the world
Of the Epistofne Criticas addressed to Knster, it
is necessary to remark, that they are the ‘original ve-
hicles by which Bentley conveyed his observatione
' upon, the tivo first Pleys ot Aristophanes. Knster, who
“ was then publishing his edition with¹ extreme haste,
dissected Bentley’s letters, end put them into the sorni
of notes, in a manner yer'y different from the inten-
tion of the writer; caresully omitting all particulare in
. which his own obserwations, which were already prin-
ted, had anticipated those of his illustrioris correspon-
dent. It is therefore dne to the 'fame of Bentley, to
give these documenta in their genuine form. He wrote
three 'letters upon the subject of Aristophanes: but only
the two last are found in this collection: of the first
he probably did not preserve a copy.
