epocha? . »
5 Will the 1504111 year of any su'ch

supposed epocha concur with
. ’· Hegira 589?

Answer. .
Yonane 1504.¹ doch plainly deuorerhe year
of an epocha· so' call’d answ'ering to Heg. 589.
(which was, as you rightly coinpute, A. C. 1195.) ·
and rt seems to me to mean the Greek year
according to the aera of the seleuciae, which 277 ,
aera began m the year before Christ 512, and
-haah been ever since used over all the East,
as Prideaux in his Connection observes. .For
yonam, or, as¹ Herbelot in his Bibliotheque
Orientale hath it, Jounan ris the name„ by
which che Eastern nations called the people ,of the
Grech· empire under the successoris¹ of Alexander.
Jouncn from the old name Jonea, who, according
α to ancient tradition, were descended from Jon,
or Jauan, the son osJapher. sosorephus (Antiq.
